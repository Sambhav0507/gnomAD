# gnomAD Assignment

This project explores genetic variation data using Jupyter Notebook, providing insights into the gnomAD dataset. You can download and run the Jupyter Notebook to interact with the data and visualize the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Click the "Code" button in the upper right corner of this repository.
   - Choose "Download ZIP" to download the entire project to your device.
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you extracted the project files.
   - Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - In your web browser, Jupyter Notebook will open, allowing you to access and run the provided notebook.

3. **Interactive Plots Note:**
   - Please note that interactive plots may not work when viewing this notebook directly on GitHub.
   - For a better experience, download and run the notebook locally using Jupyter.
   - The notebook contains two images, "graph1.png" and "graph2.png," which provide visual representations of the data.

4. **Explore and Analyze:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., "gnomAD.ipynb") and run the cells to explore the interactive plots.
   - Analyze the data, zoom in, and zoom out to gain insights from the interactive visualizations.
